    "Some of the code that you run for this dataset will take a long time, so instead of sitting at your computer wondering when it will finish, it's nice to have your computer get your attention when it's ready for you.  To this end, let's install a useful package called 'beepy'.  Since it does not come installed with Anaconda, you'll have to install it manually.  Here's how to do that:\n",
    "1.  Go to the Anaconda-Navigator application, which should be running on your computer already.\n",
    "2.  Click on 'Environments' in the left vertical pane.\n",
    "3.  Select your 'base (root)' environment, if it's not already selected.  \n",
    "    You don't have to be in base, but it will be easier.  However, if you prefer, you can create a new environment called 'IT556'.\n",
    "4.  Click the green/white icon that looks like a 'play' button and select 'Open Terminal'.\n",
    "5.  In the terminal window, install the beepy package using this command: pip3 install beepy\n",
    "\n",
    "This may take a while to run, but when it does you'll have beepy installed in your base environment, ready to be activated by an import. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now go back to Anaconda Navigator's Environments tab and make sure you are still in the same environment.\n",
    "1. Select the 'Not Installed' option of the dropdown near the top of your screen.  \n",
    "2. Search for scikit-learn.\n",
    "3. When you find it, check the box to the left of its name.\n",
    "4. Click 'Apply', which you should now see near the bottom right of your screen (or perhaps elsewhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some of the other Python packages you need may have to be manually INSTALLED by you in one of these ways (either pip install as for beepy or by using the GUI method as with scikit-learn) before you can import them without an error message.  "

    "### We did the above exercise because reshaping is often needed in machine learning.\n",
    "Color images are represented as arrays of shape: (height, width, 3).  The height (rows) and width (columns) are often (but not necessarily) the same numbers. For the CIFAR10, dataset we are using images that have shape (32, 32, 3).  That means the pictures are in the shape of a square with 32 by 32 pixels.  Each of those pixels also has 3 numbers associated with it, that's why the third dimension is '3'. Those 3 numbers represent the hue, or saturation, for each of the 3 colors red, green and blue. Hence you will see references to RGB.  Thus, in CIFAR10 it takes 32 * 32 * 3 = 3072 numbers to represent each image. These are actually quite LOW resolution images, as you will see. We are going to build several different machine learning models to try and predict the classes of previously unseen CIFAR10 images after you have trained your model, and we will look at different ways to improve our accuracy."

    "\n",
    "I just told you above that the CIFAR10 digital images have shape (32, 32, 3) so what's the extra dimension in the training and test shapes?  The CIFAR10 data is split into 50000 images for training and 10000 images for testing, so the extra dimension is telling you how many images there are.  For example, there are 50000 training images, and each image is a (32, 32, 3) array.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes you can inform the modeling software that your input data has a different shape.  For example you can do this with Keras when constructing a neural network and Keras will automatically handle the reshaping for you.  But here we will do it manually ourselves.  We will keep the first dimension (the number of images) for both training and test data, but we need to reshape the other 3 dimensions into just 1 dimension, i.e. we are going to 'flatten' the 32 by 32 by 3 arrays into a single vector of 3,072 numbers.\n",
