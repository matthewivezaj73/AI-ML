    "In my chapter 11 lecture slide called 'Network Architecture using Batch Norm' you can see some Keras code for a small network.  For this model we will build our first serious, deep model which will also use Batch Normalization (BN).  There are numerous, significant benefits of BN, so it's important to know how to use it.  One of those benefits is that you can often use a larger learning rate, which helps to significantly reduced training time.  Let's try that in this next model.  \n",

    "#### Transfer Learning\n",
    "We have discussed transfer learning before and I also discuss it again in my Chapter 11 lecture.  The idea is to load a pretrained model that operates on data that is similar to yours, and use it to recognize the low-level features of your data.  But you can delete the top layer(s) from the pretrained model, and replace it with your own top layer(s) in order to fine tune it for your specific data.  For our next model, we will use a famous predefined model called ResNet-50, which you can download directly from the web.  Let's see how it does on the CIFAR-10 data, even though it was not trained on CIFAR-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet-50 has 107 layers and was trained on ImageNet, which has (the last time I looked at it) more than 14 million high-resolution, color images in 1,000 categories. So the fact that it, and many other large models, are freely available to anyone to download and use from the web is a great service to the machine learning community.  Most individuals simply do not have enough computing power at home to train such models.\n",
